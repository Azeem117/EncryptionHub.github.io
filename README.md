# üöÄ Release v1.0.0 ‚Äì Simple Encryption Portal

## üîê Project Overview
The **Simple Encryption Portal** is a comprehensive web application designed for secure message, image, and file encryption.  
It provides users with advanced cryptography, steganography, and file-level protection, all **executed client-side in the browser**, ensuring **maximum privacy**.  

Key functionalities include:  
- Encrypt and decrypt text messages using passwords  
- Hide secret messages inside images (steganography)  
- Encrypt files of any format (images, videos, audio, documents, etc.)  

The portal is organized into **three modules**: **Encryption**, **Encryption 2.0**, and **Encryption 3.0**, each offering a unique encryption capability.

## üèóÔ∏è Modules & Features

### üîπ 1. Encryption (Basic Text Encryption)
- Encrypt messages with a password; only those with the correct password can decrypt them.  
- **Client-Side Security:** All operations happen locally in the browser; no data is sent to a server.  
- **Strong Cryptography:** Uses AES-GCM via Web Crypto API for both confidentiality and integrity.  
- **Robust Password Protection:** PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations and a randomly generated salt prevents brute-force attacks.  
- **Randomized Encryption:** Unique Initialization Vector (IV) ensures identical messages encrypted with the same password produce different outputs.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Includes password visibility toggle, copy-to-clipboard, and smooth loading spinner.  
- **Portable Output:** Encodes salt, IV, and ciphertext into a single Base64 string for easy sharing and storage.  

---

### üîπ 2. Encryption 2.0 (Steganography)
- Hide encrypted messages inside images, making the message visually undetectable.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Image quality must remain unchanged; compression or alteration may destroy the hidden message.  
- **Enhanced Security:** Combines AES encryption with pixel-level message hiding for a second layer of protection.  
- **Asynchronous & Responsive:** Processes large images using `requestAnimationFrame` to prevent browser freezing. Includes a progress bar for real-time feedback.  
- **Modern UI/UX:** Dark theme with vibrant accent colors, custom modals for alerts, password toggles, and clear instructions for users.  
- **Self-Contained:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are integrated into a single file for portability and easy hosting.  

---

### üîπ 3. Encryption 3.0 (File Encryption)
- Encrypts **any file type**, including photos, videos, audio, and documents.  
- To restore usability, rename the encrypted package back to its original format (e.g., `.jpg`, `.mp3`, `.mp4`).  
- **Strong Cryptography:** Uses AES-GCM to ensure confidentiality and integrity.  
- **Secure Key Derivation:** PBKDF2 with high iteration count protects passwords from brute-force attacks.  
- **Client-Side Operation:** No files leave the user‚Äôs browser; full privacy maintained.  
- **Responsive & Intuitive UI:** Tailwind CSS ensures usability across devices; clear file input, password field, and dedicated "Encrypt"/"Decrypt" buttons.  
- **Dynamic Feedback:** Real-time status messages and a loading spinner inform users of ongoing processes.  
- **Error Handling:** Provides user-friendly messages for incorrect passwords or corrupted files.  
- **Password Visibility Toggle:** Prevents input errors, enhancing usability.  

---

## üéØ Project Goal
The project aims to provide a **versatile, secure, and user-friendly encryption solution**, combining:  
- Password-protected message encryption  
- Hidden message embedding in images  
- Full file encryption  
- A modern, responsive, and intuitive user interface
