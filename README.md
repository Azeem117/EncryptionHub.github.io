## 🏗️ Modules & Features

### 🔹 1. Encryption (Basic)
- Write a message and lock it with a password.  
- Only someone with the correct password can decrypt it.  
- ✅ Ideal for **simple and secure text communication**.  

---

### 🔹 2. Encryption 2.0 (Steganography)
- Hide encrypted messages **inside an image**.  
- The image looks normal, making the hidden message undetectable.  
- ⚠️ **Important:** If the image is compressed or its quality is changed, the hidden message will be lost.  
- ✅ Best for **covert communication**.  

---

### 🔹 3. Encryption 3.0 (File Encryption)
- Encrypts **any file type** (photos, videos, audio, documents, etc.).  
- After encryption, rename the package back to its original format (e.g., `.jpg`, `.mp3`, `.mp4`) to restore usability.  
- ✅ Provides **secure file-level protection**.  

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
- Ensure **privacy and security** for sensitive information.  
- Provide multiple layers of encryption:  
  - Password-based message encryption  
  - Hidden message embedding in images  
  - Full file encryption
